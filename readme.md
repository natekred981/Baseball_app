# Baseball Hall of Fame Prediction Project
This project was completed with the goal of using the database given by Sean Lahman which provides all kinds of player and coaching statistics, and using the data to predict whether or not the player has made the hall of fame based on the data given. The solution to this project will be devised as a classification problem whereby the machine learning algorithm will strive to accurately determine the criteria that makes this program run. Then I will dockerize the project just for practice. 

## Getting Started
Because I am using Docker to create the project, it should be able to run out of the box properly.
