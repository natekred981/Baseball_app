# Background and Motivation
This project was completed with the goal of using the database given by Sean Lahman which provides all kinds of baseball statistics. The idea of the project was driven from my passion for baseball.
 
Using the data, my goal was to come up with an accurate machine learning algorithm to predict whether or not the player has made the hall of fame.

## How to Use
Users will be able to enter a baseball player regardless of whether they are active players or retired, and the algorithm will predict whether or not they will make the Hall of Fame. Because it is dockerized, the project will be able to be run out of the box.
